## Synopsis

* Clean interface
* Supports Mobile

## Motivation

My calculator broke and incase my tutee doesn't bring their own calculator I can use this...

The motivation behind this project is creating a version of my favourite financial calculator. I was unable to find a version of the calculator online. Similar calculators normally have many different buttons to compute for the different variables, this would force you to navigate to many different pages to find the specific calculator for your variable. This particular calculator only has one button to solve for all the different variables, therefore you may stay on the same page for all different calculations.

## Restrictions

This calcuator like many online calculators others cannot solve for the interest rate and number of periods of a bond. The calculation of those variables require **Excel**. There is probably a way to integrate it to this calculator but I was unable to find the actual formulas as they are generally overly complex.

## Tech Used

* react
* css
